# Here we need to understand that - 

#         All the changes ate local, nothing is reflected in repository universally, we can check this on webportal. 

#         After git checkout command we will be back at the last or latest commit changes in the file 

#                 ie in git checkout single-file, we will reach to last commit state of the file and all the changes will be lost 

#                 also in git checkout multiple files, we will reach to last commit state for all files and folders, 
#                     as it is done universallly on whole git local repository.
