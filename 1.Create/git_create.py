# Hello everyone,
# Here is the first part of 'GIT' tutorial series. 

# Git is a version control system that is widely accepted inside the industry and in the academic fraternity. 



# First step is to create an account in any GIT based software like Github / Gitlab etc. 

# My personal favorite is GITHUB because of its user-friendliness and because of its industry acceptance. 

# Login at Github and click on 'Create repository'. 

# Initiate repository with some description that states your purpose of creating the repository. 

# Initiate repository with README.md file by just clicking on the given option. 

# Now your repository is done and you can use it. 

print("Github Repository is done.")

# Now open repository and edit 'readme.md' file with reference to your needs and requirements. 
# It is advisable to write the 'readme.md' file in detail.
