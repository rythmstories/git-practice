# First step is to create an account in any GIT based software like Github / Gitlab etc. 

# My personal favorite is GITHUB because of its user-friendliness and because of its industry acceptance.

# Go to repository's web page. 

# Check for cloning options. 

# There will 2 options to clone - 

#       https
#       SSH 

# HTTPS : 
# Copy Https clone link by clicking on the copy.
# Here we can clone easily by the below command at local CMD - 

# git clone (copy link)

# Eg - git clone https://github.com/rythmstories/git-practice.git

print("Https Git clone ")
print("\n")
print("git clone https://github.com/rythmstories/git-practice.git")


print("\n")

# SSH :
# Copy SSH clone link by clicking on the copy. 
# Here we have to go through the below command on local cmd. 

# git clone (copy link)

# Eg - git clone https://github.com/rythmstories/git-practice.git

print("SSH Git clone ")
print("\n")
print("git clone https://github.com/rythmstories/git-practice.git")

# Here you will need to enter your credentials of Github. 



# It is preferable to go with SSH Request 

# Now enter into the repository with 'cd' command & now we are ready for any GIT operation.
